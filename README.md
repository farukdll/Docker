#### What is Docker and Why Do We Need It ? <a name="widawdwni"></a>
  * ###### What is Docker ? <a name="wid"></a>
    * ###### Docker is a platform that allows you to run different applications on your computer in an isolated way. Each application runs inside a container, which is an isolated environment at the operating system level. This allows applications to run seamlessly on different computers. It is also used to share development environments, move and deploy applications. Docker accelerates and standardizes application development and deployment processes.
  * ###### Why Do We Need Docker ? <a name="wdwnd"></a>
    * ###### Docker is revolutionary in software development processes. This technology packages software applications, making them portable and able to run in any environment. Docker containers, once created, can run effortlessly on any computer, server, or in the cloud.
    * ###### This portability allows for quick transition between developing, testing, and production environments. Moreover, Docker helps reduce conflicts between applications, allowing each application to run in its isolated environment. This enhances security and minimizes the risk of one application affecting another.
    * ###### Docker also helps in utilizing resources more efficiently. It enables running multiple applications isolated from each other on a single server, minimizing resource waste and reducing the likelihood of interactions between applications.
    * ###### In summary, Docker standardizes software development processes, ensures smooth operation of applications, helps optimize resource usage, and enhances security. This makes your software development process faster, more reliable, and more flexible.
  * ###### What Are the Advantages of Docker ? <a name="watafd"></a>
    * ###### Separates applications from each other, preventing any interaction.
    * ###### It enables fast deployment, meaning you can start and stop applications quickly.
    * ###### It consumes few resources, which increases efficiency.
    * ###### It does not use a hypervisor and does not have a fully installed operating system, so it is up and running and ready to use in seconds.


#### What is Container and Comparison with Hypervisor <a name="wicacwh"></a>
  * ###### What is a Container ? <a name="wiac"></a>
    * ###### Containers are isolated working environments at the operating system level. Each Container contains everything an application or service needs to run: files, libraries, settings and other components necessary for the application to run.
    * ###### This isolation allows each Container to run independently of the others. That is, the application in one Container does not affect the application in another Container. This makes it possible to run applications in a more secure, portable and efficient way.
    * ###### Containers enable developers to avoid compatibility issues when moving their applications to different environments. They also make software development processes more efficient by enabling faster deployment, scaling and management.

  * ###### What is Hypervisor (VM) ? <a name="wihvm"></a>
    * ###### Hypervisor is software or hardware that allows you to run different operating systems in isolation by creating virtual machines on physical hardware. It allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously by dividing a physical machine with virtual machines.
    * ###### Hypervisor (VM) Examples:
      * ###### VMware vSphere/ESXi: A powerful Hypervisor for large data centers.
      * ###### Microsoft Hyper-V: A Windows-based hypervisor with a wide range of features.
      * ###### Oracle VM VirtualBox: User-friendly and can run on a variety of operating systems.
      * ###### Citrix Hypervisor (XenServer): A hypervisor offering scalable cloud solutions.
      * ###### KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine): An open source Hypervisor based on Linux.

  * ###### Differences and Advantages of Containers and Hypervisors <a name="daaocah"></a>
    * ###### Differences :
      * ###### Containers:
        * ###### The host shares resources with the operating system and provides its isolation in this way.
        * ###### They are lighter and consume fewer resources because the host operating system allocates resources.
      * ###### Hypervisors:
        * ###### Each one hosts its own full operating system, offering a completely isolated environment.
        * ###### They use more resources because each one runs its own operating system.
    * ###### Advantages :
      * ###### Containers:
        * ###### They start faster and offer high performance because they are lighter.
        * ###### They speed up software development processes because they are quickly launched and deployed.
      * ###### Hypervisors:
        * ###### They offer a more secure environment by providing complete isolation but consume more resources.
        * ###### They support different operating systems, making them easy to use on various platforms.
