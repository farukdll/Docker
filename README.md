#### What is Docker and Why Do We Need It ? <a name="widawdwni"></a>
  * ###### What is Docker ? <a name="wid"></a>
    * ###### Docker is a platform that allows you to run different applications in an isolated manner on your computer. Each application runs in a container, which is an operating system-level isolated environment. This enables applications to run smoothly on different machines. It is also used for sharing development environments, transporting, and deploying applications. Docker accelerates and standardizes application development and deployment processes.
  * ###### Why Do We Need Docker ? <a name="wdwnd"></a>
    * ###### Docker is revolutionary in software development processes. This technology packages software applications, making them portable and able to run in any environment. Docker containers, once created, can run effortlessly on any computer, server, or in the cloud.
    * ###### This portability allows for quick transition between developing, testing, and production environments. Moreover, Docker helps reduce conflicts between applications, allowing each application to run in its isolated environment. This enhances security and minimizes the risk of one application affecting another.
    * ###### Docker also helps in utilizing resources more efficiently. It enables running multiple applications isolated from each other on a single server, minimizing resource waste and reducing the likelihood of interactions between applications.
    * ###### In summary, Docker standardizes software development processes, ensures smooth operation of applications, helps optimize resource usage, and enhances security. This makes your software development process faster, more reliable, and more flexible.
  * ###### What Are the Advantages of Docker ? <a name="watafd"></a>
    * ###### It separates applications from each other, preventing any interference.
    * ###### It enables quick deployment, allowing for swift starting and stopping of applications.
    * ###### It consumes fewer resources, thereby increasing efficiency.
    * ###### It doesn’t use a hypervisor and doesn’t host a full-fledged operating system, making it start and ready for use within seconds.
